Place your backoffice brand marks in this folder.

Recommended files:
- `logo-full.svg`: main horizontal lockup for light backgrounds.
- `logo-icon.svg`: square-only mark if you need a compact option.

Import them with the standard Vite alias, e.g. `import logo from "../assets/logo/logo-full.svg";`.
